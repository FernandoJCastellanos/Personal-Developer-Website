So I did. Intern in \r\n                    a couple of movie sets that changed my life. The act of recording a movie is a \r\n                    movie by itself. Got to see and worked with the best talent in the country. \r\n                    How they think, move and talk. It was a blessing and an experience that I will \r\n                    never forget.\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"exp-row-container\">\r\n            <div className=\"exp-container\">\r\n                <div className=\"exp-title\">\r\n                  <p>Advertising Hell Hole</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"exp-text\">\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    A quote from a book I read back in college.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                      “The advertising world is where the Artist goes to die.”\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    I never wanted to work in an Ad agency, but the Idea of being a Creative Director\r\n                    really caught my attention. I didn't know that being a Creative was a job and a \r\n                    career. So I delved deep into it and wanted to find out everything I could about \r\n                    it. Interned in one of the top Ad agencies as a Creative Junior got to experience\r\n                    the life cycle and the process of creativity and campaigns from the perspective\r\n                    of the Creative Director and the whole crew. Art Director and Copywriter. \r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    It was fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n              <div className=\"exp-container\">\r\n                <div className=\"exp-title\">\r\n                  <p>Entrepreneurship, Business and Freelance.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"exp-text\">\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    While having to work on myself, my skills and my art.\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    I had to learn about business, clients, and what it means to be an entrepreneur\r\n                    running your own business. Having to market yourself, talk to clients, negotiate\r\n                    and keep strong for all those 7 years. All while doing it yourself with no one\r\n                    else helping you except the mentors I chose on the internet. I will forever be\r\n                    grateful and hope to someday meet my heroes and  give them a hug. For telling\r\n                    me that I can do this, all I need to do is to stay strong and believe in myself!\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  export default BackgroundExperience;\r\n  "],"mappings":";;AACA;;AAGA;;AAYA,MAAMA,oBAAoB,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EAC/B,oBACEC,OAAA;IAAKC,EAAE,EAAC,aAAa;IAAAC,QAAA,gBAEnBF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,eACEF,OAAA;QAAGG,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAAAD,QAAA,GAAC,uBACP,eAAAF,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5B;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACD,CAAC,eAKNP,OAAA;MAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAsB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAEnCF,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAGhCF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC1BF,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,eACxBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAAiB;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACrB,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;YAAAD,QAAA,eACvBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAMH;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACD,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC,eAGNP,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC5BF,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,eACxBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAAS;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACb,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;YAAAD,QAAA,eACvBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAWH;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACD,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAGL,CAAC,eAGNP,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAGhCF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC1BF,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,eACxBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAAkB;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACtB,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;YAAAD,QAAA,eACvBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAOH;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACD,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC,eAGNP,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC5BF,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,eACxBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAA0B;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAC9B,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;YAAAD,QAAA,eACvBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAQH;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACD,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAGL,CAAC,eAINP,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;QAAAD,QAAA,gBAChCF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC1BF,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,eACxBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAAqB;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACzB,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;YAAAD,QAAA,eACvBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,GAAG,6CAED,eAAAF,OAAA;gBAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAI,CAAC,sEAEL,eAAAP,OAAA;gBAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAK,CAAC,keAON,eAAAP,OAAA;gBAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAIP;YAAA;cAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACD,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC,eAENP,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC5BF,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAD,QAAA,eACxBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAAyC;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAC7C,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;YAAAD,QAAA,eACvBF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,GAAG,uDAED,eAAAF,OAAA;gBAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAK,CAAC,ieAOR;YAAA;cAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACD,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAEP,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAED,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACL,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OAIH,CAAC;AAER,CAAC;AAAAC,EAAA,GAvJGT,oBAAoB;AAyJxB,eAAeA,oBAAoB;AAAC,IAAAS,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
