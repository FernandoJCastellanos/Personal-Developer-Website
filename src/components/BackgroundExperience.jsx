                    In the attempt of not being a poor starving artist I decided to pivot into a 
                    different career. Like the nerd that I am. I’ve always been interested in 
                    programming. Seeing how much these kids are being compared to all the other kids. 
                    It was an obvious decision for me. Jumped into the Computer Science rabbit hole. 
                    Landed in Frontend Development, eventually will run back into the Creative industry.

                    Living my dream of being a movie director. Being able to do everything from 
                    conceptualizing ideas to bringing them to life. Being able to do all the roles 
                    all at once, make all the decisions by myself, wearing the hats of: the Director,
                    Producer, Art Director, Director of Photography, etc, etc… etc.
                    Being able to immerse myself in myself, discovering who I am and what I want to 
                    become. Understanding the struggles of the artist and fully becoming one. While 
                    trying to produce work and developing skill sets to be able to afford food. 
                    It was a beautiful journey. But I have now found Bitcoin and I’m now in the money 
                    game.

                    Picking up 2D Motion Design while I was at my first job. Watching tutorials as 
                    soon as I get home tired and all. I still kept watching tutorials and learning 
                    about the 2D animation world and After Effects. I knew this was important so I 
                    kept pursuing this no matter how tired I was after work. This was the only thing
                    I was interested in back then.

                    I got an Advertising Degree so I could pursue a solid safe Movie Director Career,
                    after being convinced by a Movie Director who did the same. So I did. Intern in 
                    a couple of movie sets that changed my life. The act of recording a movie is a 
                    movie by itself. Got to see and worked with the best talent in the country. 
                    How they think, move and talk. It was a blessing and an experience that I will 
                    never forget.

                    A quote from a book I read back in college.
                    <br/>
                      “The advertising world is where the Artist goes to die.”
                    <br />
                    I never wanted to work in an Ad agency, but the Idea of being a Creative Director
                    really caught my attention. I didn't know that being a Creative was a job and a 
                    career. So I delved deep into it and wanted to find out everything I could about 
                    it. Interned in one of the top Ad agencies as a Creative Junior got to experience
                    the life cycle and the process of creativity and campaigns from the perspective
                    of the Creative Director and the whole crew. Art Director and Copywriter. 
                    <br/>
                    It was fun.

                    While having to work on myself, my skills and my art.
                    <br />
                    I had to learn about business, clients, and what it means to be an entrepreneur
                    running your own business. Having to market yourself, talk to clients, negotiate
                    and keep strong for all those 7 years. All while doing it yourself with no one
                    else helping you except the mentors I chose on the internet. I will forever be
                    grateful and hope to someday meet my heroes and  give them a hug. For telling
                    me that I can do this, all I need to do is to stay strong and believe in myself!
